# LRU pytorch experiments
An experimental framework to train LRU networks in pytorch (linear recurrent unit networks, see Orvieto et al., *Resurrecting Recurrent Neural Networks for Long Sequences*, 2023), and fit dynamical systems with them, among other tasks.

Also supporting material for my blog post [RNNs strike back](https://adrian-valente.github.io/2023/10/03/linear-rnns.html) in the notebook ds_exps.ipynb.

Code adapted from the jax/flax implementation of N. Zucchet [minimal-LRU](https://github.com/NicolasZucchet/minimal-LRU).

Still unstable and may change significantly.
